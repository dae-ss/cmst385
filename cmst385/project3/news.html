            <h3>Kanye West's Unconventional Super Bowl Ad</h3>
            <p>
                Controversial rapper and entrepreneur Kanye West has once again made headlines after revealing an unconventional ad during the Super Bowl to promote his merchandise.
                In the commercial, West is seen filming himself on an iPhone in the back of a vehicle, while calling on viewers to visit his e-commerce store, Yeezy.com, where he said he has "got some shoes and that's it," before the clip cuts out.
                The setup drew attention for its blatant simplicity, standing out amid the typically large-budget commercials aired during the event, for which slots reportedly sell for seven million dollars per 30-seconds.
                Yet, it appears that, despite all its minimalism, West's ad itself ultimately reimbursed the costly price of the placement, bringing in 19.3 million dollars for the rapper, who revealed the accumulated revenue in an Instagram post on his personal profile.
